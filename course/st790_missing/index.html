Missing data are ubiquitous in almost every area
of scientific inquiry, and especially in health sciences research
involving human subjects.   <p>

The classical definition of missingness is that data that were intended
to be collected in a prospective study were not.  For example, in a
medical study designed to collect data longitudinally on every
participant at a prespecified series of follow-up times, some subjects
may fail to appear at the clinic for intended measurements at one or
more times or, more ominously, drop out of the study and never return
after a certain point.  If the reasons for failure to appear or dropout
are related to the issues under study, e.g., if subjects who are
benefiting less from their assigned treatments are more likely to drop
out, intuitively, failure to acknowledge this somehow could distort
conclusions.  Missing data of this type are such a great challenge in
pharmaceutical and biotechnology research that in 2010 the US Food and
Drug Administration asked the National Research Council of the
National Academy of Sciences to convene an expert Panel on the
Handling of Missing Data Clinical Trials to develop guidance on how
missingness should be handled in the regulatory context. <p>

Missingness also occurs in data that arise in other contexts.  For
example, in retrospective analysis of observational data already
collected, such as those from completed studies or captured in other
large databases, it is routinely the case that not all variables are
available on all subjects or other units.  Contrary to popular belief,
"big data" are not somehow exempt from issues of missingness.  For
example, the use of electronic health records, which are of course
observational in nature, is of great current interest in the study of
the comparative effectiveness of drugs and other interventions.  The
fact that some subjects have relatively more observations than others
often reflects the fact that less healthy individuals tend to have
more encounters with the healthcare system.  These same individuals
may also be more likely to receive certain interventions and to have
health outcomes worse than those those of healthier individuals.
Thus, there is a relative "missingness" of information among different
individuals that is likely associated with the issues under study.<p>

Missing data have important implications for analysis.  At the very
least, there is a loss of information and reduction in precision of
inference on the population of interest relative to that intended.  Of
much greater concern is the potential for biased and misleading
inferences that can result if the reasons for missingness are related
to outcomes of interest.  Accordingly, principled methods to take this
challenge into appropriate account are required.<p>

This course  provides an overview of modern statistical frameworks
and methods for analysis in the presence of missing data.  Both
methodological developments and applications are emphasized.  The
course provides a foundation in the fundamentals of this area that
will prepare students to read the current literature and to have broad
appreciation the implications of missing data for valid inference.  <p>


<h2>Course prerequisites</h2>
