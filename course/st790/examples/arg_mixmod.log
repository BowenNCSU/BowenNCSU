You are running SAS 9. Some SAS 8 files will be automatically converted 
by the V9 engine; others are incompatible.  Please see

PROC MIGRATE will preserve current SAS file attributes and is 
recommended for converting all your SAS libraries from any 
SAS 8 release to SAS 9.  For details and examples, please see

4          
5            Fit a subject-specific nonlinear mixed effects model to the
6            argatroban PK data in Section 9.5 of Davidian and Giltinan (1995)
7            by fitting a "linear mixed effects model" using transformed
8            individual-specific estimates as "data."  These "data" are
9            read in from the first stage pooled GLS algorithm in the
10           program arg_mixsetup.R, which creates the needed file "argmixsig.dat"

29             individual covariance model sigma^2 I.  The HOLD option
30             allows the user to hold some or all of these values fixed at the
31             given values - here, we hold the 4th, corresponding to
32             sigma^2, = 1.  The values for the elements of D are thus
33             starting values and were chosen based on other fits of
