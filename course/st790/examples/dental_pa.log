28           Fit the basic model with separate intercepts and slopes for
29           both genders with several different assumptions on the overall
30           covariance structure.  Overall covariance structure is specified
31           in the REPEATED statement.  We take this to be the same for both
31       ! genders
32           as well as different for each gender, which is specified using the
33           GROUP = option in the REPEATED statement.  We also include fitting
34           of a heterogeneous compound symmetric structure, which allows
35           different variances at each time point.  See the SAS documentation
36           for the REPEATED statement for a list of all the possible
36       ! covariance
37           model specifications.
38         
39           We use REML to fit all these models, but in the first call to MIXED
40           show the options for specifying ML and for getting the "robust"
40       ! sandwich
41           covariance standard errors (EMPIRICAL option)
42         
43           We can compare the various fits of the same mean model using AIC
43       ! and BIC.
44           When ML is used, PROC MIXED defines BIC using what we have called
44       ! N,
45           When REML is used
46         
47         
48             Thus, these will differ across implementations

49           but can be compared within implementation.

51           The R and RCORR options in the REPEATED statement have an option to
52           print out the estimated covariance and correlation matrices for
53           specific -- we print out these for the first girl (1) and first boy

149        
150            Examination of the AIC, BIC suggests that a compound symmetric
151            that is different for each gender with different constant
151      ! variance
152            across time for each gender is preferred.
153        
154            This model is adopted in further analyes shown below.  We use ML
155            to fit a full model with different slopes and reduced model with
156            same slop, so that the likelihood ratio test statistic can be
156      ! calculatd.
157            The COVB optoin prints out the covariance matrix of the fixed
158            effects estimates.
159        
160            We then reparameterize the model to get the Wald and F tests for
161            differences in intercept and slope and do
162        
163           We fit the first parameterization this time, so that the estimates
164           are interpreted as the gender-specific intercepts and slopes.
165           Thus, the TESTS OF FIXED EFFECTS in the output should be
165      ! disregarded.
