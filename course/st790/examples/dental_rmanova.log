93         
94           Using the REPEATED statement, one can obtain specialized within-
95           individual tests; the REPEATED statement allows one to specify
96           diffrent contrast matrices U.  We demonstrate with two calls to
97           PROC GLM like the one above specifying the Helmert and polynomial
98           transformations.
99         
100          In both, the SUMMARY option asks that PROC GLM print out the
100      ! results
101          of tests corresponding to the contrasts in each column of the U
102          matrix.
103        
104          The PRINTM option prints the U matrix; SAS calls the transpose
105          of this matrix M, so the M printed is our U'.

110          First request the orthogonal polynomial transformation.  Here, SAS
111          DOES use the normalized version of the U matrix.  Thus, the SSs
112          from the individual ANOVAs for each column will add up to the
112      ! Gender
